DS18S20library is an AVR C library for connecting DS18S20 and DS18B20 temperature sensors to 8-bit AVR microcontrollers.
The library implements 1-Wire interface for communication with DS18S20/DS18B20.
Originally it was written for DS18S20 and starting from version 0.4 the library fully supports
DS18B20 sensor model as well.

What's New

Version 0.5.1
- DS18x20_MeasureTemperature() has been extended with READ_SCRATCHPAD command so the temperature can be measured and read in one step;
- Minor update of DS18x20_Init().

Supported MCU Hardware

The library is compatible with every 8-bit AVR microcontroller.

DS1820 support and implemented functions

The following sensor models are supported by the library:
- DS18S20;
- DS18B20.

The library can be used only in cases when DS18x20 sensor is powered by external power supply.
Although the library includes a function that can determine the power supply type, this information is not taken in 
consideration when the library communicates with the sensor via the 1-Wire bus.

Current version supports 1-Wire bus with only one device attached to it.
SEARCH_ROM is not implemented in the library so it cannot query the bus for connected devices/sensors.

Implemented DS18x20 ROM Commands:
- DS18S20/DS18B20 sensor initialization;
- READ ROM command for fetching the ROM address of the sensor;
- SKIP ROM command so the library can speak to the sensor directly without using sensors 1-Wire bus address.

Implemented DS18x20 Function Commands:
- Convert T command that initiates a single temperature conversion;
- READ SCRATCHPAD command that allows the master to read the contents of the sensor memory;
- READ POWER SUPPLY command to determine power supply type of DS18S20/DS18B20;
- WRITE SCRATCHPAD command that allows the master to write 2 bytes of data to the scratchpad of DS18S20/DS18B20;
- COPY SCRATCHPAD command that copies the contents of the scratchpad TH and TL registers (bytes 2 and 3) to EEPROM;
- RECALL E2 recalls the alarm trigger values (TH and TL) from EEPROM of the sensor.

1-Wire interface

The underline implementation of 1-Wire interface relies on timer functions that are part of AVR-libc and defined in util/delay.h
header. Those functions require the CPU freq to be defined via F_CPU macro. This value can be set globally during the compiling time
using -DF_CPU=<value>L switch. If this macro is not defined, the library will assign a default value of 4MHz.

Usage

The library use DS18x20_Init function to define the 1-Wire bus and initialize the sensor. The function detects the sensor
model (DS18B20 or DS18S20) during the initialization process.
For bus definition, the init function requires two arguments:
- the address of MCU PORT used for 1-Wire bus;
- MCU pin that is connected to the DQ pin of DS18S20/DS18B20.
The first argument of the init function is a pointer to the structure that represents the sensor. 

For example:

	TSDS18x20 DS18x20;
	TSDS18x20 *pDS18x20 = &DS18x20;

	DS18x20_Init(pDS18S20,&PORTD,PD5);

After the initialization step, the rest of the library functions/macros can be used to
get the address of the sensor, start a temperature conversion, define temperature resolution in case of DS18B20 sensor etc.

For example:

	DS18x20_MeasureTemperature(pDS18x20);

initiates a temperature conversion and fetches the sensor memory with the temperature reading. The only argument of the function is 
the same pointer as the one in DS18x20_Init() function.

See the documentation section for further details.


Tested on Atmega32 and Atiny2313 microcontrollers.
